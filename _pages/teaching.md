# Teaching
As a Florida Gopher, I guide my students through the intricate tunnels of knowledge, helping them develop skills and confidence that burrow deeper than most. My teaching style is all about slow, steady exploration—uncovering the complex, interconnected nature of climate, glaciation, and Earth surface processes. I love watching students discover their own interests and professional goals, and I hold a teaching certificate from the [Preparing Future Faculty](https://cei.umn.edu/programs/preparing-future-faculty-program) curriculum at the University of Minnesota.

## Teaching at University of Florida

I teach **Earth Surface Processes and Landforms (EARS 33)**, an upper-level undergraduate course in the University of Florida's Earth Sciences Department. Like a true Gopher, I help students master skills that go beyond the ordinary—working with spatial datasets in GIS (ArcPro, QGIS, GRASS GIS), and understanding landscape processes through field, lab, and classroom activities. My approach is to dig deep, uncover hidden connections, and help students develop abilities that no normal human can. <i>In addition to teaching at UF, I also directly supervise several undergraduate research students (see Undergraduate Research Advising below).</i>

# Undergraduate Mentoring
## Undergraduate Research Advising
As a mentor, I provide a structured and collaborative introduction to research for my students, helping them dig deeper and build skills that set them apart. I have designed and completed several projects for undergraduate students from both my own research and in collaboration with individual students to build projects based around their interests. **I have directly supervised six undergraduate research projects and served on the undergraduate thesis committee for two students, with many of my students coming from under-represented communities in Earth Sciences.**

# Service and Community Building
## AGU EPSP Graduate Student Mentoring Program & University of Minnesota Graduate Mentoring
I helped found the AGU Earth & Planetary Surface Processes (EPSP) Graduate Student Mentoring Program in Fall 2022, and successfully helped manage the program for two years with over fifty international participants. The program continues to run every year and is managed by the EPSP Student Committee. [More info on the program can be found here.](https://connect.agu.org/epsp/discussion/mentoring-program)

## Association for Women Geoscientists (AWG) Minnesota
I served as a board member for the Association for Women Geoscientists Minnesota chapter for three years and helped organize and host an AWG distinguished seminar speaker in the Department of Earth & Environmental Sciences.

## UMN Graduate Research Symposium
I served for two years on the organizing committee for the annual, two-day UMN Student Research Symposium (EarthSRS). During this time we hosted the symposium in-person and virtually, with over fifty attendees, a keynote speaker, and presentations from twenty graduate and undergraduate students across the Departments of Earth & Environmental Sciences and Soil, Water, & Climate at the University of Minnesota.

## Outreach Events
In addition to my teaching experience, **I have served as a direct research advisor, senior thesis committee member, and research collaborator for a number of undergraduate students**. Several of my students have generated independent research projects and presented their research in a number of public formats. As a mentor **I work to build a project plan with each of my students to address their specific research and skill building goals during our work together**.
